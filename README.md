# Chat App

A React Native chat application built with Expo, Firebase (Firestore + Storage), and Gifted Chat. Users can enter their name, choose a background color, chat in real time, send images, and share their location.

## Features

- **Start Screen**:

  - Text input for user name with validation
  - Color picker with 4 background color options
  - Elegant UI with styled components and shadows
  - Form validation (name required before proceeding)
  - Keyboard handling to prevent UI coverage

- **Chat Screen**:

  - Full chat UI with Gifted Chat
  - Real-time messaging backed by Firestore
  - Image sharing to Firebase Storage (download URLs saved in Firestore)
  - Share current location; renders a map bubble with a marker
  - Custom action button that opens an Action Sheet with four actions
  - Accessibility labels and roles on interactive elements
  - Keyboard handling and user avatars

- **Navigation**:
  - Stack navigation between Start and Chat screens
  - Passes user data (name and color) between screens
  - Custom navigation header styling

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Mobile app framework
- **Expo**: Development platform and toolchain
- **React Navigation**: Navigation library for screen transitions
- **Gifted Chat**: Complete chat UI and functionality library
- **React Hooks**: useState, useEffect, and useCallback for state management
- **KeyboardAvoidingView**: Cross-platform keyboard handling
- **Firebase**: Firestore for chat messages; Cloud Storage for media uploads
- **Expo Image Picker** for gallery/camera; **Expo Location** for GPS; **react-native-maps** for map bubbles

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS (18.x or 20.x) and npm
- Git
- Expo tooling (used via npx)
- For Android build/emulator:
  - Android Studio with a "Google APIs" emulator image (API 33+ recommended)
  - Android SDK Platform Tools (added to PATH by Android Studio)
- For iOS (macOS only): Xcode with iOS Simulator

On Windows, install Android Studio and create a Pixel emulator. No separate Java install is needed—Android Studio bundles it.

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd chat-demo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Install required packages:

   ```bash
   npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
   npm install react-native-gifted-chat --save
   ```

4. Install media, location, and maps packages (Expo managed):
   ```powershell
   # Match versions to your Expo SDK automatically
   npx expo install expo-image-picker expo-location react-native-maps
   ```

## Firebase setup (Firestore + Storage)

1. In Firebase Console, create a project (or use your existing one) and add a Web app to get the config.
2. Copy your Web config into `firebase.js` (replace the placeholder values if needed).
3. Enable Cloud Firestore and Cloud Storage in the Console.
4. Verify your Storage bucket. In most projects the default is `<projectId>.appspot.com`. If uploads fail and your bucket differs from `firebaseConfig.storageBucket`, update it accordingly.

This app initializes Firestore and connects Cloud Storage using `getStorage(app, \`gs://${firebaseConfig.storageBucket}\`)`. Instances are exported from `firebase.js` and passed to screens via props.

### Storage security rules (development)

For quick local testing you can temporarily allow authenticated users to read/write:

```text
rules_version = '2';
service firebase.storage {
   match /b/{bucket}/o {
      match /{allPaths=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
      }
   }
}
```

Remember to tighten these rules for production.

### Where to put credentials

- Open `firebase.js` and replace the `firebaseConfig` object with your project’s Web app config from Firebase Console (Project settings → General → Your apps → Web app).
- Ensure the `storageBucket` matches your project’s bucket. The app binds Storage to that exact bucket via `getStorage(app, \`gs://${firebaseConfig.storageBucket}\`)`.

## Running the App

1. Start the Expo development server:

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

2. Choose how to run the app:

   - Expo Go (fastest):
     - Android: Press `a` to open in Expo Go on the emulator
     - iOS: Press `i` to open in iOS Simulator with Expo Go
   - Native build (standalone dev client):
     - Android: `npm run android` (runs `expo run:android`, uses Android Studio)
     - iOS (macOS): `npm run ios`

3. Smoke test features:
   - Select or take a photo → image bubble appears
   - Share location → map bubble appears with a marker

## App Flow

1. **Start Screen**: User enters their name and selects a background color
2. **Navigation**: User taps "Start Chatting" to navigate to chat screen
3. **Chat Screen**: Displays personalized welcome with chosen background color

## Available Background Colors

- **Black** (#090C08) - Default
- **Dark Purple** (#474056)
- **Blue Gray** (#8A95A5)
- **Light Green** (#B9C6AE)

## Feature checklist (submission requirements)

The app implements the following:

- [x] Action sheet with four actions: select an image, take a photo, send location, cancel (`components/CustomActions.js`).
- [x] Storage implementation for media in Google Firebase Storage (`firebase.js` init + `uploadBytes/uploadString` + REST fallback).
- [x] Image URLs saved in Google Firestore (messages written by `components/Chat.js -> onSend`, with `image` field from Storage download URL).
- [x] Location information collected from device, stored in Firestore, and rendered on a map bubble (`location` field + `renderCustomView` with `react-native-maps`).
- [x] Accessibility props applied on the CustomActions TouchableOpacity (`accessibilityRole`, `accessibilityLabel`, `accessibilityHint`).
- [x] Properly formatted, commented code (see file headers and inline comments in `Chat.js` and `CustomActions.js`).
- [x] Project setup manual (this README).
- [ ] Screen recording showcasing app features (see instructions below to record and add the link/file).

If anything is missing for your review flow, file an issue or ping us—happy to adjust.

## Recording a demo (Android Emulator or device)

You can attach a short screen recording and link it here:

1. Android Emulator: three-dots (Extended controls) > Record and Playback > Start recording. Reproduce features, then Stop recording. This produces a `.webm` file.
2. Physical Android device: enable screen recording from Quick Settings; or use `adb shell screenrecord`.
3. iOS Simulator: File > New Screen Recording; or QuickTime Player with your device attached.

Place the recording under `assets/demo/` and link it here:

```
[Demo video](./assets/demo/chat-demo.webm)
```

Alternatively, upload to a share (Drive/Dropbox/YouTube Unlisted) and paste the URL.

## Emulator tips for location sharing

If “Current location is unavailable” appears on the emulator:

- Ensure Location services are ON in the emulator (Settings > Location > Use location ON).
- Inject a mock location:
  - Android: Extended controls (⋮) > Location > choose a preset (e.g., San Francisco) or enter coordinates > Set Location.
  - iOS: Simulator menu Features > Location > select a preset.
- Grant app permissions for “Location” (While in use + Precise).
- Use a “Google APIs” AVD image for Android.
- Cold boot the emulator after changing settings.

## Testing

The app has been tested with:

- Form validation (empty name handling)

For reviewers: the “Feature checklist” above maps directly to the submission rubric. The only manual artifact to add is the screen recording—see “Recording a demo”.

**Note**: This implementation includes both Exercise 5.3 (navigation setup) and Exercise 5.4 (chat functionality with Gifted Chat).
